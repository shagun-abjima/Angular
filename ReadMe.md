One way data binding:- (Data flows in one direction like from component to view or from view to component)1.TS->Template(String interpolation{ {{data}} } and Property Binding { [property]="value" })2.Template->TS(Event Binding){(click)="onClick()"}
Two way data binding:-(Data flow from component to its view template and at the same time ,from view template to component class,Combination of property binding and event binding)ngModel.{[(ngModel)]=searchtext}(We have to import formsModule in app module and add it in imports.)
